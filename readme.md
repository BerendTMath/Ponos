# Ponos
Ponos is a web based, locally hosted time and productivity tracker, enabling people to analyze and optimize their behavior, productivity, and happiness with the help of detailed graphs.
This project is comparable to the time tracker toggle.com, but with 2 major differences:
-	Ponos can easily be hosted on your own network, giving you control over your own data
-	There exists a build in to-do list
-	Plot custom variables across time
-	The project can also easily be customized
